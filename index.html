            <p style="margin-left: 150px;" style="margin-right: 200px;" style=>Travel is the key to a well rounded person.  We should always be striving to experience the new, the different.  How can we formulate ideas of the world without experiencing them ourselves?  Seeing new places, experiencing new cultures and hearing new languages are the goal.  However, how do we accomplish this in the most authentic way possibe?  Traditional tour guides and companies can be overpriced, and too heavily influenced by those persons they wish to serve.  Here at Wanderlust Assitants, we strive to provide the most authentic, and real experiences for out customers? By linking them with local, college age guides.

                These guides can provide the traditional tour guide experiences.  They can show you the Trevi fountain, escort you through Times Square, and provide the history of the Pyramid at Giza.  What we provide along with that is a unique perspective on local fare.  From cuisine to nighlife, from accomodations to excursions, our guides can provide authentic experiences like only a true local can, while navigating the gulf in languages and culture to remove all but the thinnest patina between you and the experiences you desire.</p>
